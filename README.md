 ##Request
 Create a simple album list, photo list and photo detail application, using data from:

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com. Make sure that you use Redux and persist the data, so that if you close and open the app it doesn’t fetch again.

Your project should be hosted on GitHub and shared with petergerdes, don’t forget to add your name to your GitHub profile. From the moment of the initial commit, you have 48 hours to do as much as you can (you can choose yourself when you start depending on when you have time). Try to keep your commits clear!

There are no rules other than it should run (after running npm install) on iOS and Android, just make it cool!

You will be judged on things like architecture, readability, animation, git usage, design, performance, third party usage and more.

We know it's a short time span, and you'll be working on it in spare time, so try and focus on your strengths.
